   Wanna know a secret? Promise not to tell?   We are standing by a wishing well  Make a wish into the well That's all you have to do And if you hear it echoing Your wish will soon come true         I'm wishing For the one I love  I'm wishing    To find me Today To find me Today    I'm hoping And I'm dreaming of I'm hoping    The nice things He'll say The nice things He'll say       I'm wishing For the one I love  I'm wishing   To find me Today To find me    Today  Now that I've found you Hear what I have to say  One song I have but one song One song Only for you  One heart Tenderly beating Ever entreating Constant and true  One love That has possessed me One love Thrilling me through  One song My heart keeps singing Of one love Only for you

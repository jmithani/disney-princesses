  Some day my prince will come Some day I'll find my love And how thrilling that moment will be When the prince of my dreams comes to me He'll whisper "I love you" And steal a kiss or two Though he's far away I'll find my love some day Some day when my dreams come true Some day I'll find my love Someone to call my own And I'll know him the moment we meet For my heart will start skipping a beat Some day we'll say I do Things we've been longing to Though he's far away I'll find my love some day Some day when my dreams come true Somewhere waiting for me There is someone I'm longing to see Someone I simply can't help but adore Someone who'll thrill me forever Someday my prince will come Someday I will find the one Though he's far away He'll find my love someday Someday when my dreams come true Oh please make my dreams come true

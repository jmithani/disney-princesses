   Okay, can I just - say something crazy? I love crazy!   All my life has been a series of doors in my face And then suddenly I bump into you I was thinking the same thing! Cause, like, I've been searching my whole life to find my own place And maybe it's the party talking, or the chocolate fondue...   But with you but with you I found my place I see your face And it's nothing like I've ever known before   Love is an open door Love is an open door  Love is an open door With you With you With you With you Love is an open door   I mean it's crazy  We finish each others' Sandwiches! That's what I was gonna say! I never met someone who thinks so much like me Jinx. Jinx again! Our mental synchronization can have but one explanation You and I were just meant to be!   Say goodbye  to the pain of the past We don't have to feel it anymore   Love is an open door Love is an open door  Life can be so much more With you With you With you With you Love is an open door    Can I say something crazy? *Anna giggles* Will you marry me? Can I say something even crazier? Yes!

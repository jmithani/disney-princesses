Look at the world, so close, and I'm halfway to it! Look at it all, so big - do I even dare? Look at me, there at last! I just have to do it Should I? No Here I go... Just smell the grass! The dirt! Just like I dreamed they'd be! Just feel that summer breeze, the way it's calling me For like the first time ever, I'm completely free! I could go running And racing And dancing And chasing And leaping And bounding Hair flying Heart pounding And splashing And reeling And finally feeling Now's when my life begins!

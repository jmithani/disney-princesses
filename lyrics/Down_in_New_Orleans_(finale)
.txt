  In the South Land, there's a city Way down on the river Where the women are very pretty And all the men deliver  They got music, it's always playin' Start in the day time, go all through the night And when you hear that music playin' Hear what I'm sayin', make you feel alright  Grab somebody, come on down Bring your paintbrush, we're paintin' the town There's some sweetness goin' around Dreams do come true in New Orleans

   What would I give To live where you are? What would I pay To stay here beside you? What would I do to see you Smiling at me?  Where would we walk? Where would we run? If we could stay all day in the sun? Just you and me And I could be Part of your world  I don't know when I don't know how But I know something's starting right now Watch and you'll see Some day I'll be Part of your world

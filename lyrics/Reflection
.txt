     Spend some time away Getting ready for the day Youre born again Spend some time alone Understand that soon youll run With better men   Alone again Alone again Alone again Alone again Alone   No use looking out Its within that brings that Lonely feeling Understand that when you leave here Youll be clear Among the better men   Alone again Alone again Alone again Alone again Alone Alone again Alone again Alone again Alone again Alone

   Please don't run away!  I won't hurt you.  I'm awfully sorry, I didn't mean to frighten you.  But you don't know what I've been through!  And all because I was afraid.  I'm so ashamed of the fuss I've made.  What do you do when things go wrong?   Oh, you sing a song!     With a smile and a song Life is just a bright sunny day Your cares fade away And your heart is young  With a smile and a song All the world seems to waken anew Rejoicing with you As the song is sung  There's no use in grumbling When raindrops come tumbling Remember, you're the one Who can fill the world with sunshine  When you smile and you sing Everything is in tune and it's spring And life flows along With a smile and a song   I really feel quite happy now.  I'm sure I'll get along somehow!  Everything's going to be all right.  But I do need a place to sleep at night.  I can't sleep in the ground like you.  Or in a tree the way you do!  And I'm sure no nest could possibly be big enough for me.  Maybe you know where I can stay?  In the woods somewhere?  You do!  Will you take me there?

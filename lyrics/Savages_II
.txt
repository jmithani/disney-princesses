  I am a god, I am prescient I am religion I see the future, I see the path Follow me, follow the vision I have become the ultimate power I am protection I am Messiah, I am a tyrant I show the path to redemption To man man and the universe  Transformed in to something else A being of nothing alike Invincible, unbreakable A creatures of numinous might And inside my head I am talking to the dead  Ancient memories Are whispering in me Father, give me guidance To the path you have foreseen  Uh, I carry the burden Of the world  Out in the oceans of sand I saw the future Of a golden land Below the plains I've been meeting my fate I stood the test The universe In the palm of my hand Oh am I blessed Or cursed  And by the water of life In the agony of spice I saw visions of doom I saw demise I am perpetual A sentinel in time And for eternity You will remember me by  Far away the nemesis Is rising again in the dark The day will come When the scorch of man Is ready to embark  I see reflections From other memories I see the slaughterhouse Of the thinking machines Rein of terror Reign of the machines  Out in the oceans of sand  I set the universe On the golden path To seed desire Passion and wrath As the millenniums Are passing by I did my part Time has come For me to die  You'll remember me by  Out in the oceans of sand
